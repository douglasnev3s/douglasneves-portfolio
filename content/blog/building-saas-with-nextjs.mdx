Building Suprify, our B2B SaaS platform for printer fleet management, has been an incredible journey of technical challenges and architectural decisions. Here are the key lessons learned from developing a multi-tenant SaaS application that serves managed print service providers.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Next.js for B2B SaaS?

When starting Suprify, I needed a framework that could handle both the marketing site and the application itself. Next.js proved to be the perfect choice for several reasons:

- **Full-stack capabilities**: API routes allowed me to build the entire backend in one codebase
- **SEO optimization**: Static generation for marketing pages improved our search visibility
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations reduced load times for our dashboard
- **TypeScript support**: Essential for maintaining code quality as the team grows

### Multi-tenant Architecture

One of the biggest challenges was designing a multi-tenant system that could scale. Here's how we approached it:

```typescript
// Tenant isolation at the database level
const getUsersByTenant = async (tenantId: string) => {
  return prisma.user.findMany({
    where: {
      tenantId: tenantId
    }
  });
};
```

```typescript
// Middleware for tenant resolution
export function withTenant(handler: ApiHandler) {
  return async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    const tenantId = await resolveTenant(req);
    if (!tenantId) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Tenant not found' });
    }
    
    req.tenant = tenantId;
    return handler(req, res);
  };
}
```

## Database Design

### PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM

We chose PostgreSQL for its reliability and JSON support, paired with Prisma ORM for type safety:

```prisma
model Tenant {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  subdomain String   @unique
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  users     User[]
  printers  Printer[]
  
  @@map("tenants")
}
```

```prisma
model Printer {
  id       String @id @default(cuid())
  name     String
  ipAddress String
  tenantId String
  
  tenant   Tenant @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
  
  @@map("printers")
}
```

### Real-time Data Challenges

Handling real-time printer data required careful consideration of database performance:

- **Connection pooling**: Essential for handling multiple tenants
- **Indexing strategy**: Composite indexes on tenant_id + timestamp
- **Data retention**: Automatic cleanup of old monitoring data

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Organization

We organized components around business domains rather than technical layers:

```bash
components/
├── tenant/
│   ├── TenantSelector.tsx
│   └── TenantSettings.tsx
├── printers/
│   ├── PrinterList.tsx
│   ├── PrinterCard.tsx
│   └── PrinterMetrics.tsx
└── dashboard/
    ├── Overview.tsx
    └── Charts.tsx
```

### State Management

For a B2B application, we found that React's built-in state management combined with SWR for server state worked perfectly:

```typescript
import useSWR from 'swr';

const usePrinters = (tenantId: string) => {
  const { data, error, mutate } = useSWR(
    tenantId ? `/api/tenants/${tenantId}/printers` : null,
    fetcher,
    {
      refreshInterval: 30000, // Refresh every 30 seconds
      revalidateOnFocus: false
    }
  );

  return {
    printers: data,
    isLoading: !error && !data,
    isError: error,
    refresh: mutate
  };
};
```

## Key Technical Challenges

### SNMP Protocol Integration

Integrating with printers via SNMP protocol required building a Node.js service that could handle multiple concurrent connections:

```javascript
const snmp = require('net-snmp');

class PrinterMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.sessions = new Map();
  }

  async monitorPrinter(printer) {
    const session = snmp.createSession(printer.ipAddress, 'public');
    
    const oids = [
      '1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.4.1.1', // Black toner level
      '1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.4.1.2', // Cyan toner level
      // ... other OIDs
    ];

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      session.get(oids, (error, varbinds) => {
        if (error) {
          reject(error);
        } else {
          resolve(this.parseTonerLevels(varbinds));
        }
        session.close();
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Billing Integration

Stripe integration for B2B requires handling complex billing scenarios:

- **Metered billing**: Based on number of monitored printers
- **Subscription management**: Handling plan changes and cancellations
- **Multi-seat pricing**: Per-user pricing within tenant organizations

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimization

- **Query optimization**: Using Prisma's query analysis tools
- **Connection pooling**: PgBouncer for production deployments
- **Read replicas**: For analytics and reporting queries

### Frontend Performance

- **Code splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
- **Image optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Caching strategy**: Aggressive caching for dashboard data

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Containerization with Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app

# Dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Error tracking**: Sentry for error monitoring
- **Performance monitoring**: Web Vitals tracking
- **Business metrics**: Custom dashboards for key SaaS metrics

## Business Lessons

### MVP vs. Enterprise Features

Starting with a focused MVP helped us validate the market, but B2B customers quickly demanded enterprise features:

- **SSO integration**: Essential for larger organizations
- **Advanced permissions**: Role-based access control
- **API access**: Customers wanted to integrate with their existing systems
- **White-label options**: Some customers needed branded solutions

### Customer Feedback Loop

Building a B2B product requires constant customer communication:

- **Weekly customer calls**: Direct feedback from power users
- **Feature request tracking**: Systematic prioritization of requests
- **Beta testing program**: Early access to new features

## Key Takeaways

1. **Choose boring technology**: PostgreSQL and Next.js were reliable choices that let us focus on business logic
2. **Start simple**: Our initial architecture was much simpler, we added complexity as we grew
3. **Customer-driven development**: B2B customers have very specific needs, listen to them
4. **Monitor everything**: In B2B, uptime and performance directly impact customer business
5. **Plan for scale**: Multi-tenancy decisions made early saved us months of refactoring

## What's Next?

We're currently working on:
- **Mobile app**: React Native app for field technicians
- **AI insights**: Machine learning for predictive maintenance
- **Marketplace**: Third-party integrations and add-ons

Building a B2B SaaS product is challenging but incredibly rewarding. The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL has served us well, and I'd recommend this stack for other SaaS founders.
